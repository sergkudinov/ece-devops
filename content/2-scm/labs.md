# Labs

The goal of this lab is to discover Git, how it interacts with GitHub or other repository managers and to practice using it mainly through the command line.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- GitHub account

## Methodology

  - The workshop is not a manual or a list of commands to execute, it merely states a set of goals for each section. You will have to find out how to achieve them.
  - Should a problem arise you are encouraged to take initiative and troubleshoot it yourself. If the scope of the problem seems too big or confusing you can of course request help.
  - Teamwork is encouraged. This workshop can be done on your own, or in groups of 2/3 people.

## Resources

- https://git-scm.com/ - the official git website
- https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf - A summary of the git commands proposed by GitHub

## Work

### 1. Creating a repository and accessing it:

  - Create a private repository on your GitHub account
  - Clone this repository on your machine with the git command
  - Create some files in your repository and commit them
  - Push your changes on your GitHub account
  
### 2. Good Practices and tips:

  - Modify multiple files and commit them one at a time
  - Change your git apparent user name and email address
  - Store your git credentials so you donâ€™t have to enter them each time.

### 3. Working with multiple people:

  - Invite someone else to collaborate on your repository and have them clone it. (If you are doing the workshop alone, clone your repository elsewhere to simulate another coworker.)
  - Let the other coworker commit and push some files to your repository
  - Get the changes from your coworker on your machine (without re-cloning the repo)
  
### 4. Working with branches:

  - Create a dev branch on your project and add some commits to it. Push the branch to the repo
  - Merge the dev branch into the master branch
  - Add a few commits to the master branch
  - Have a coworker add some files on a feature branch, rebase this branch on dev then merge dev on master

### 5. Resolving conflicts:

  - From the same commit, create two branches in which the same file is modified but not in the same way Try to merge one branch into the other
  - Resolve the conflicts by picking the version you prefer
  - Optional: Try this part again with a git GUI tool of your choice

### 6. Proposing changes:

  - Fork the repository of a coworker on your GitHub account
  - Clone the forked repo, create a new branch, add some commits to it
  - Create a Pull Request on the original repository and have your coworker approve it

### 7. Tags:

  - Add a tag on a commit and push it
  - Add a few commit, then go back to the tagged version
  
### 8. Going Further:

  - Create a new empty repository on GitHub and set it as the new remote of your current project
  - Make some changes, stash them to have a clean work copy. Restore them
  - Make some changes, cancel them before commiting them
  - Add some commits to a branch. Push them. Delete them, localy and remotely
