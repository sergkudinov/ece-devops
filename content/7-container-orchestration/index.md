# Container orchestration

The portability and reproducibility of a containerized process mean we have an opportunity to move and scale our containerized applications across clouds and datacenters. Containers effectively guarantee that those applications run the same way anywhere, allowing us to quickly and easily take advantage of all these environments. Furthermore, as we scale our applications up, weâ€™ll want some tooling to help automate the maintenance of those applications, able to replace failed containers automatically, and manage the rollout of updates and reconfigurations of those containers during their lifecycle. Tools to manage, scale, and maintain containerized applications are called **orchestrators**.
