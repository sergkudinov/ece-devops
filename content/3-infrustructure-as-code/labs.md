# Labs


## Prerequisites
  
1. Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. Install Vagrant on your computer - https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
3. (Optional) **On Windows**, ensure that Hyper-V is disabled:
   1. Open a new PowerShell

## Resources

- In case of impassable resource limit of your local machine you are allowed to use Katacoda environment to work on this lab -  https://www.katacoda.com/jonatanblue/scenarios/1

## Work

### 1. Prepare a virtual environment

Since Ansible can not be installed on Windows host ([see the source](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements)), to avoid issues associated with the platform on which Ansible is running, we will use a virtual environment.

We will use the [`ansible_local` provisioner](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible_local.html) what will install Ansible on [CentOS 7](https://www.centos.org/) Linux distribution virtual machine by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). So, you don't need Ansible on your computer!

The next step once youâ€™ve installed Vagrant is to create a `Vagrantfile` and customize it to suit your needs. This is covered in detail in [the Vagrant documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/), and for this lab we will use a prepared `Vagrantfile`.

Take a look at the [`Vagrantfile`](assets/Vagrantfile) and at the YAML files [`playbooks/run.yml`](../assets/lab-8-ansible/playbooks/run.yml). To have more information how the `Vagrantfile` is configured follow this [Vagrant Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_vagrant.html)

### 2. Create and provision a VM

```bash
cd assets
vagrant up
```

You should end up with the following error (this is planned): 
 
```bash
TASK [gitlab/install : Install GitLab] *****************************************
fatal: [gitlab_server]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "No package matching 'gitlab-ee' found available, installed or updated", "rc": 126, "results": ["No package matching 'gitlab-ee' found available, installed or updated"]}
```

### 3. Check that everything is ok by connecting to the VM through SSH:

```bash
vagrant ssh gitlab_server
```

### 4. Complete the GitLab installation

   1. Fill the blanks in [`gitlab/install/tasks/main.yml`](assets/playbooks/roles/gitlab/install/tasks/main.yml) based on the steps 1. and 2. of the [GitLab installation doc for CentOS 7](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#centos-7)
   2. Update the playbooks on the VM using `vagrant upload`:
      ```
      vagrant upload playbooks /vagrant/playbooks gitlab_server
      ```
   3. Rerun provisioning with the command `vagrant provision`

### 5. Test your installation 

Test by connecting to http://20.20.20.2 (step 3 of the [GitLab installation doc](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#centos-7)):

   1. Choose a password
   2. Login as the user `root` using the password
