## The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

- Customer satisfaction is top priority

- Project pace should be sustainable and be maintained
- Pay attention to technical aspects and design
- Keep it simple
- Teams should be self-organised
- Reflect on the progress and process used regularly
