# Introduction to DevOps

The DevOps culture focus on one goal throughout the entire software delivery lifecycle (not just development and operations): the rapid implementation of stable, high-quality software, from concept to customer or user. The automation of software development, testing and deployment through Continuous Delivery (CD) is a recognized key factor for DevOps. Automation enables faster software implementation and ensures the solutions have the quality, security and stability they need.
